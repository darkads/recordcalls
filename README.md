# RecordCalls #

===

This is an application which allows user to record calls. The application consists of a setting page which allows for toggling of this recording function.

**Note that:** Due to lockdown of functionality by some telcos, some phones might not work without root, or even with root. 

App is currently buggy.
If you have any idea on solving this, don't hesitate to contact me. Thanks!
